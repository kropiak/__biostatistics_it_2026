# Lab 01. Intruduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language, one of the most popular (probalby top 1 now) in the world.

## 1. A short history of Python

**Python was created by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum**, and the name itself, which may not surprise some, comes from the popular BBC series “Monty Python's Flying Circus.” **Work on the first Python interpreter began in 1989** as a successor to the ABC language. All versions up to version 1.2 were developed at CWI (Center for Mathematics and Computer Science) in Amsterdam, where Guido was working at the time. Since version 2.1, Python has been available as an open source project through the non-profit **Python Software Foundation** (PSF). Currently, many people are working on the development of Python, but Guido is still involved in the process. Update 2021: After disputes with the community over the future direction of Python, Guido is now much less involved in the process.

The creator himself emigrated to the US in 1995, where he worked for Google from 2005 to 2013 and then for Dropbox (until October 2019). In the Python community, van Rossum served as Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) until July 2018, which means that he oversaw the development of the language, making final decisions when necessary. In 2019, he was still a member of the Python Steering Council, but withdrew his candidacy for 2020. After leaving Dropbox, he announced his retirement, but in November 2020, he announced that he was joining Microsoft to continue developing Python.

An important moment in the history of Python was the creation of a second main branch – **Python 3 in 2008.** From that moment on, versions 2 and 3 were developed separately, but the time of version 2 has effectively passed, as evidenced by the end of support on April 12, 2020. The language is developed using PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal). These documents are proposals for extensions or changes to the language in the form of an article that is discussed among Python developers. Each document contains a description of the proposed solution, justification, and current status. Once a consensus is reached, the proposals are accepted or rejected.

The document https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/ presents The Zen of Python, which outlines the ideas behind the language's syntax used by its creators, but is also a set of recommendations for other programmers using this language.

## 2. Getting started

The best way to learn skills that require action is to follow the maxim “learning by doing.” The most important concepts of the language and selected elements of programming itself will be presented using examples contained in a Jupyter notebook available in the file **lab_01_intro_to_python.ipynb**.  
The environment in which we will run, process, and learn them is Google Colab. It is a service that allows you to run notebooks and code snippets directly from your browser window without having to install anything locally. Below are the steps necessary to run the notebook mentioned above.

**_Step 1_**

Log in into your Google Account (if you do not have any, you should create one) by using web browser on the computer.

**_Step 2_**

Visit the [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) address.

**_Step 3_**

From the **File** menu choose an option **Open notebook** and find position **GitHub**. Paste the address of the notebook provided on this laboratory (file with the .ipynb extension - here the **[lab_01_intro_to_python.ipynb](lab_01_intro_to_python.ipynb)** file) and confirm. When the notebook opens in the browser move to next step.

**_Step 4_**

Create a copy of the notebook on your private Google Drive. Go to **File** menu and find option like **create a copy on your Drive** and choose it. 

**_Step 5_**

Follow the instructions placed within the opened notebook.

**_Step 6_**

When your work is finished, share the notebook with the lecturer by using the **Share** button inthe upper right corner. You should share this notebook by providing the lecturers email address: kaszpiro@gmail.com.
